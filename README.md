# OpenHardware_Rover

This Rover is based on Arduino and Raspberry PI 2.

The way to operate the rover and use the camera, is using a Wiimote and Nunchuk connected with the Arduino by a Bluetooh connection.

On the one hand, Arduino controls the servos and the brushless motor.

On the other hand, Raspberry Pi2 manages the video streaming send to the PC that you can watch in VLC.
